# Kotlin Color Mixer App

The Kotlin Color Mixer App is a project developed for a school assignment. It is designed to allow users to experiment and mix colors in an interactive and engaging way.

## Key Features

- **Color Mixing**: Users can mix primary colors (red, blue, green) to create various secondary and tertiary colors.
- **Interactive Interface**: A user-friendly interface that enables easy selection and mixing of colors.
- **Real-Time Color Display**: Provides a real-time preview of the resulting color as users mix different colors.
- **Educational Purpose**: Aims to educate users, especially students, about color theory and how primary colors combine to form other colors.

## Implementation Details

- **Kotlin Language**: The entire application is written in Kotlin, taking advantage of the language's conciseness and expressive features.
- **User Interface**: Utilizes Android's UI components, such as Buttons and TextViews, to create an interactive interface for color selection and mixing.
- **Color Mixing Algorithm**: Implements a color mixing algorithm that calculates the resulting color based on the selected primary colors.
- **Real-Time Display**: Utilizes event listeners to update the color preview in real-time as users interact with the app.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the application on an Android device or emulator.
4. Select the primary colors (red, blue, and green) by tapping the corresponding buttons.
5. Observe the resulting color in real-time as you mix the selected colors.
